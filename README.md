## Description
The aim of this project was to modify a starter code that creates an application which enables employees to generate random passwords based on the criteria selected.

### Problems Solved

* I started with creating global variables for each password characters.

* Also created variables with empty strings for possible password character and the selected criteria.

* I noticed the generatepassword() function was undefined, so: 

* * I added the .prompt, .alert and .confirm windows in the function, so that when you click on the generatepassword(), the prompts would appear.
* * Declared the value for the Selector variables if true.

* * I added a for loop to enable the password to generate and loop, according to the criteria selected.

* Finally I returned the password.
